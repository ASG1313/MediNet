# MediNet
MediNet is a unique Python-based client-server application tailored to healthcare, where patients and doctors are the clients. Using socket programming, the server listens for client connections, authorizes usernames, and relays messages among connected doctors and patients. The client, built with a tkinter GUI, connects to the server, sends messages, and displays received messages. With a straightforward interface, patients can relay their symptoms to doctors, who can then reply with possible prescriptions and diagnoses.
