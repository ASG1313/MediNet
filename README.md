# MediNet
MediNet is a Python-based client-server application tailored to healthcare, where patients and doctors are the clients. The server, using socket programming, listens for client connections, authorises usernames, and relays messages among connected doctors and patients. The patients send symptoms and doctors reply with prescriptions and diagnoses.
